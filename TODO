Checks in Cython module: array dimension.

Implement GPU max pooling

Border effects

Move opencl source code into a subdirectory like a standard data directory.

BUGS

* The convolution does not work with GPU in float64 format. This is
very weird, it looks like the multiplication between kernel and src
data returns zero at fixed 2d locations.


DONE

* Fix GPU convolution

* Non-contiguous buffer for multi-convolution (OpenCL implementation
requires contiguous arrays, not necessarily in C-order).

* GPU multi convolution

* Make OpenCL use FLOAT typedef rather than hard-coded float

* Pass compilation options nicely

* Pass CPU/GPU as argument to OpenCL.
