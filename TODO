* Fix GPU convolution
* Non-contiguous buffer for multi-convolution
* GPU multi convolution

* Make OpenCL use FLOAT typedef rather than hard-coded float
* Pass compilation options nicely
* Pass CPU/GPU as argument to OpenCL.

Checks in Cython module: array dimension and contiguity (for GPU routines).

* DEBUG: looks like the GPU implementation sometimes screws up completely... why???
Error checking

Implement GPU max pooling
Border effects

BUGS

The convolution does not work with GPU in float64 format. This is very
weird, it looks like the multiplication between kernel and src data
returns zero at fixed 2d locations.
